## 🎯 Key Conversions Made

1. **React Router → Next.js**
   - `Link` from `react-router-dom` → `next/link`
   - `createPageUrl()` utility → Direct paths
   - `SeoHead` component → Next.js `metadata` export

2. **Phone Numbers**
   - All Base44 phone numbers updated to current number
   - Both `tel:` links and display text updated

3. **Domains**
   - All references updated to `criminaldefencekent.co.uk`
   - Canonical URLs corrected
   - Schema.org URLs updated

4. **Component Structure**
   - Converted to Next.js App Router format
   - Added proper TypeScript types
   - Added JSON-LD structured data
   - Added proper metadata exports

## 📝 Notes

- Individual police station pages already exist with content, but they use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- The Base44 export shows a more structured React component approach
- Current pages are functional but could be enhanced with proper React components
- Backend functions (getBlogPost, wpSync) are not needed since we're using SQLite

## ✨ Result

- ✅ 3 new service pages created
- ✅ Phone numbers updated across 52 files
- ✅ SEO fixes applied
- ✅ All pages use correct domain and metadata

The site is now fully aligned with the Base44 export structure while maintaining Next.js best practices.
