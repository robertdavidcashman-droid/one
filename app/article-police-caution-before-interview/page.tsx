It is not a "caution" in the sense of an outcome or disposal—rather, it is a formal warning given to suspects before they are questioned about an alleged offence.</p><p>Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and Code C of the PACE Codes of Practice, anyone who is arrested or interviewed as a suspect must be cautioned before any questions are asked about their suspected involvement in an offence<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p class="font-semibold text-lg text-slate-900">The standard caution wording is:</p><div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 my-4"><p class="font-bold text-blue-900 italic text-lg">"You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence."</p></div><p>This wording has been in use since the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 introduced provisions allowing adverse inferences to be drawn from a suspect's silence in certain circumstances<sup>[2]</sup>.</p></div></div><div class="rounded-xl border bg-white text-slate-900 shadow mb-8"><div class="flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6"><div class="font-semibold tracking-tight text-2xl">Breaking Down The Caution: What Each Part Means</div></div><div class="p-6 pt-0 space-y-6 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed"><div><h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">"You do not have to say anything"</h3><p>This is an unequivocal statement of your right to silence. You cannot be forced to answer questions. You cannot be compelled to provide an account. This right is enshrined in common law and protected by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial<sup>[3]</sup>.</p><p>The right to silence means that remaining silent during interview is not, in itself, an admission of guilt. Silence is a neutral position, and historically, no adverse inference could be drawn from it.</p></div><div><h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">"But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court"</h3><p>This is the critical qualification introduced by Section 34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994<sup>[4]</sup>. It permits a court or jury to draw "such inferences as appear proper" from a defendant's failure to mention facts during interview that they later rely upon in their defence at trial.</p><p><strong>What this means in practice:</strong> If you choose to remain silent in interview but later provide an explanation or defence at court that you could reasonably have been expected to mention when questioned, the court may draw an adverse inference. The prosecution may argue that your silence suggests you fabricated your account later, after having time to think.</p><p>This does not mean silence is automatically damaging. The courts have established strict conditions for when adverse inferences may be drawn, including that the suspect must have had access to legal advice<sup>[5]</sup>.</p></div><div><h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">"Anything you do say may be given in evidence"</h3><p>Every word you say during a police interview is recorded and can be used as evidence against you in court. This includes not just formal interviews under caution, but also any comments you make in the police car, in the custody suite, or to officers during breaks.</p><p>It is crucial to understand that anything you say can be taken out of context, misunderstood, or contradicted by other evidence. Even seemingly innocent comments can become critical pieces of prosecution evidence.</p></div></div></div><div class="rounded-xl border bg-white text-slate-900 shadow mb-8"><div class="flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6"><div class="font-semibold tracking-tight text-2xl">When Must The Caution Be Given?</div></div><div class="p-6 pt-0 space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed"><p>PACE Code C is clear about when a suspect must be cautioned<sup>[6]</sup>:</p><ul class="space-y-2 ml-6"><li class="flex items-start gap-2"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-circle-check-big w-5 h-5 text-green-600 flex-shrink-0 mt-1"><path d="M21.801 10A10 10 0 1 1 17 3.335"></path><path d="m9 11 3 3L22 4"></path></svg><span><strong>Upon arrest:</strong> The caution must be administered immediately when a person is arrested.</span></li><li class="flex items-start gap-2"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-circle-check-big w-5 h-5 text-green-600 flex-shrink-0 mt-1"><path d="M21.801 10A10 10 0 1 1 17 3.335"></path><path d="m9 11 3 3L22 4"></path></svg><span><strong>Before any questions:</strong> A person who is being questioned about an offence must be cautioned before any questions are asked.</span></li><li class="flex items-start gap-2"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-circle-check-big w-5 h-5 text-green-600 flex-shrink-0 mt-1"><path d="M21.801 10A10 10 0 1 1 17 3.335"></path><path d="m9 11 3 3L22 4"></path></svg><span><strong>When suspicion focuses:</strong> If during general questioning, grounds for suspicion arise, the person must be cautioned immediately.</span></li><li class="flex items-start gap-2"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-circle-check-big w-5 h-5 text-green-600 flex-shrink-0 mt-1"><path d="M21.801 10A10 10 0 1 1 17 3.335"></path><path d="m9 11 3 3L22 4"></path></svg><span><strong>Re-caution after break:</strong> The caution must be repeated when questioning resumes after a significant break.</span></li><li class="flex items-start gap-2"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-circle-check-big w-5 h-5 text-green-600 flex-shrink-0 mt-1"><path d="M21.801 10A10 10 0 1 1 17 3.335"></path><path d="m9 11 3 3L22 4"></path></svg><span><strong>Voluntary interviews:</strong> The caution must be given even if the person is not under arrest but is attending voluntarily to be interviewed as a suspect.</span></li></ul><p>Failure to properly caution a suspect may result in any subsequent admissions or statements being ruled inadmissible at trial under Section 78 of PACE, which allows a court to exclude evidence if admitting it would have an adverse effect on the fairness of proceedings<sup>[7]</sup>.</p></div></div><div class="rounded-xl border bg-white text-slate-900 shadow mb-8"><div class="flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6"><div class="font-semibold tracking-tight text-2xl">Special Cautions and Variations</div></div><div class="p-6 pt-0 space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed"><div><h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">The "Special Warning" (Sections 36 &amp; 37 CJPOA 1994)</h3><p>In certain circumstances, additional warnings may be given alongside the standard caution.

There are many legitimate reasons for not answering questions, including that you may be confused, traumatized, protecting someone else, or simply following legal advice. The law requires the prosecution to prove guilt; you do not have to prove innocence.</p></div><div><h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Misconception 2: "If I tell the truth, everything will be fine"</h3><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Even truthful accounts can be misinterpreted, taken out of context, or contradicted by flawed evidence. You may not know what other evidence exists. Speaking without legal advice can be disastrous even when innocent.</p></div><div><h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Misconception 3: "Only guilty people ask for a solicitor"</h3><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Asking for a solicitor is a fundamental right and a sensible precaution whether innocent or guilty. Courts and police recognize this. Requesting legal advice cannot be used as evidence of guilt<sup>[11]</sup>.</p></div><div><h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">Misconception 4: "The caution is just a formality"</h3><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The caution is legally significant. It marks the point at which a person becomes a suspect and their rights crystallize. Everything that follows the caution is evidentially critical.</p></div></div></div><div class="rounded-xl border bg-white text-slate-900 shadow mb-8"><div class="flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6"><div class="font-semibold tracking-tight text-2xl">References and Legal Authorities</div></div><div class="p-6 pt-0 space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-600"><div><p><sup>[1]</sup> Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Section 66; Code C, paragraph 10.1</p></div><div><p><sup>[2]</sup> Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Sections 34-37</p></div><div><p><sup>[3]</sup> European Convention on Human Rights, Article 6; <em>Murray v United Kingdom</em> [1996] 22 EHRR 29</p></div><div><p><sup>[4]</sup> Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Section 34</p></div><div><p><sup>[5]</sup> <em>R v Argent</em> [1997] 2 Cr App R 27; <em>Condron v United Kingdom</em> [2001] 31 EHRR 1</p></div><div><p><sup>[6]</sup> PACE Code C (2019 Revision), paragraphs 10.1-10.6</p></div><div><p><sup>[7]</sup> Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Section 78; <em>R v Samuel</em> [1988] QB 615</p></div><div><p><sup>[8]</sup> Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Sections 36-37; PACE Code C, paragraph 10.11</p></div><div><p><sup>[9]</sup> PACE Code C, paragraph 10.5, Note 10D</p></div><div><p><sup>[10]</sup> <em>R v Roble</em> [1997] Crim LR 449; <em>R v Betts and Hall</em> [2001] 2 Cr App R 16</p></div><div><p><sup>[11]</sup> PACE Code C, paragraph 6.5; <em>R v Chandler</em> [1976] 1 WLR 585</p></div></div></div></article><div class="rounded-xl border shadow bg-red-600 text-white"><div class="p-8 text-center"><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Need Legal Advice About A Police Interview?</h3><p class="mb-4 text-lg">Free police station advice available 24/7.
